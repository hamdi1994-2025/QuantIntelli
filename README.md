## ✨ Core Features   

🧠 **Dual-Engine Analysis:**  
Combines a fast **XGBoost model** for baseline statistical predictions with a deep **Google Gemini LLM** for contextual analysis.

🌐 **Advanced RAG Pipeline:**  
Dynamically searches the web using **Tavily, Google, and DuckDuckGo** to gather real-time, relevant information like team news, injuries, form, and H2H stats.

📄 **Content Enrichment:**  
Goes beyond snippets by fetching and parsing full-text articles from top-ranking search results to provide deeper context to the LLM.

📊 **Structured Analytical Output:**  
Generates a detailed, professional-grade report with sections for **Dual Recommendation**, **Conflict Resolution**, **Market Efficiency**, and **Risk Analysis**.

💾 **Persistent Session Logging:**  
Uses **Supabase** to log every prediction and its subsequent analysis, creating a traceable record of the agent's reasoning.

🕹️ **Interactive UI:**  
Built with **Gradio** for an intuitive, easy-to-use interface that guides the user through the two-stage analysis process.

## 🚀 How It Works: The Analysis Pipeline

QuantIntelli+ operates a unique two-stage workflow to deliver its insights.

### 1. **🎯 Stage 1: The Statistical Prediction**
*   A user inputs match odds (e.g., `Liverpool vs Chelsea 2.1 3.4 3.8`).
*   The pre-trained **XGBoost model** instantly processes the odds and outputs a baseline prediction (Home Win, Draw, or Away Win) with probabilities.
*   This initial session is logged to **Supabase**, creating a unique ID for the match.

### 2. **🔍 Stage 2: The Deep-Dive Analysis**
*   The user toggles "Analysis Mode" and asks for a deeper dive.
*   **The RAG pipeline activates:**
    *   It generates targeted queries (`"Liverpool injury news"`, `"Chelsea recent form"`, etc.).
    *   It dispatches these queries across multiple search providers (Tavily, Google) for comprehensive coverage.
    *   Top results are "enriched" by fetching the full webpage content.
*   **The LLM synthesizes the data:**
    *   A meticulously crafted prompt is sent to **Google Gemini**, containing the statistical prediction, market odds, and all the enriched web context.
*   **The final report is generated:**
    *   Gemini returns a structured, multi-part analysis.
    *   This analysis, including the extracted contextual outcome, is logged back to the original Supabase record.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Access to Google Gemini, Tavily, and Google Custom Search APIs
- A Supabase project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantintelli.git 
cd quantintelli
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your API keys and credentials. Use `.env.example` as a template:

```env
# Google Gemini API
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your_supabase_service_key"
SUPABASE_PREDICTION_TABLE_NAME="your_table_name" # e.g., 'predictions'

# Web Search APIs (Optional, but recommended for full functionality)
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
GOOGLE_API_KEY_CS="your_google_cloud_platform_api_key"
GOOGLE_CSE_ID="your_google_custom_search_engine_id"
```

### 4. Place Model Files
Ensure your trained model and scaler files are placed in the `model/` directory:
```
model/xgboost_model.pkl
model/scaler.pkl
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Navigate to the local URL provided by Gradio (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) to start interacting with QuantIntelli+.
